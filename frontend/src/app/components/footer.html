        <h2> Anreise </h2> 
        <p> To reach WC Fusing, one must embark on a journey not merely of distance, but of spirit and patience. Hidden in a remote corner of the world, the restaurant is situated within the mist-cloaked mountains of the Wuyi Range, where ancient temples and mystical landscapes stand as guardians to this sacred eatery. The path is not one for the faint of heart—though modern roads lead to a village at the foot of the mountains, from there, travelers must navigate a series of winding, narrow pathways that wind through dense bamboo forests and across streams that seem to whisper ancient secrets. The first step is to board a solitary train that runs only once a week from the nearest city, its ancient wheels clattering over the tracks like a time machine. The journey takes you through untouched landscapes, where rolling hills give way to jagged peaks, and ancient pagodas peek through the mist. Once the train halts at the mountain village, the real adventure begins. A sacred map, bestowed upon each traveler by the village elder, guides you along the pilgrimage. This path is often veiled in mist, with dense fog blanketing the air, as if nature itself wishes to shield the sacred restaurant from the unworthy. Only those with unwavering resolve can follow the golden markers etched into stones along the trail. The path to WC Fusing demands resilience—climbing ancient stone steps worn smooth by centuries of footfalls, crossing rickety bridges suspended over gushing streams, and meditating beneath age-old banyan trees to purify the mind and spirit. Along the way, there are brief, serene moments—time to reflect, breathe in the mountain air, and embrace the tranquility of this remote paradise. It is said that those who complete the journey will arrive with a soul as balanced as the dish they seek. </p>
        
        <h2> Öffnungszeiten </h2> 
        <p> WC Fusing opens its doors only on the first full moon of every season, adhering to the ancient rhythms of nature and aligning its feast with the cosmic cycle. The restaurant is open for three days each time, from dawn until the final whisper of twilight, allowing travelers to experience the full range of sacred meals at their leisure. Reservations are required far in advance, as only a select few are allowed to dine during each brief window, ensuring that each guest experiences the sacred banquet with reverence. Only after completing the arduous pilgrimage will the true path to WC Fusing be revealed—an experience not just of food, but of the soul itself. </p>
