# Web-Projekt: Restaurant

The "Moderne Restaurant mit automatisiertem Bestellungsverfahren" project aims to revolutionize the dining experience by creating a streamlined, digitalized ordering process. This project combines cutting-edge web technologies and a robust backend to enhance both the customer and staff experience in a restaurant setting. Through this automated system, customers will be able to seamlessly make reservations, view real-time table availability, and order from a digital menu, reducing wait times and improving order accuracy.

## Overview

The system will utilize a QR code generator to provide each table with a unique digital identity, enabling guests to access the menu and place orders directly from their mobile devices. The process covers essential functionalities, from table occupancy and reservation tracking to order processing and payment.
